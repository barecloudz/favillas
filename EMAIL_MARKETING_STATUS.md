# Email Marketing Feature - Current Status

## ✅ What's Working

1. **Templates Available** - 5 professional email templates are now accessible:
   - Weekly Special
   - Birthday Offer
   - Loyalty Reward
   - New Menu Announcement
   - Win-Back Campaign

2. **API Deployed** - The `/api/admin/email-marketing` endpoint is live on preview branch

3. **Frontend Fixed** - Modal is now responsive and templates load correctly

4. **Graceful Error Handling** - Templates will load even if database tables don't exist yet

## ⚠️ What Needs Setup

### 1. Database Tables (REQUIRED)

You need to create two database tables in Supabase. Run the SQL scripts in `docs/email-marketing-setup.md`:

- `email_campaigns` table - stores campaign history
- `email_logs` table - tracks individual email sends
- `marketing_opt_in` column in users table

**To set this up:**
1. Open your Supabase project dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Copy/paste the SQL from `docs/email-marketing-setup.md`
4. Run the queries

### 2. Resend Email Configuration (REQUIRED)

Set these environment variables in Netlify:

- `RESEND_API_KEY` - Your Resend API key
- `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` - Verified sender email (e.g., noreply@favillaspizza.com)

**To set this up:**
1. Go to https://resend.com and create an account
2. Verify your sending domain
3. Get your API key
4. Add both variables in Netlify: Site settings → Environment variables

## 🧪 Testing

Once you've completed the setup above:

1. Go to Admin Dashboard → Email Marketing tab
2. Click "Create Campaign"
3. Select a template from the dropdown
4. Choose "Test Mode"
5. Enter your email address
6. Click "Send Campaign"
7. Check your inbox

## 📊 Logs & Debugging

The API includes detailed logging. If emails aren't sending:

1. Check Netlify function logs
2. Look for these indicators:
   - `📧 From email:` - Shows the sender email
   - `📧 Resend API configured:` - Shows if API key is set
   - `✅ Test email sent successfully` - Confirms send
   - `❌ Resend error:` - Shows any errors

## 🚀 Deployment

The code is already deployed to the preview branch:
- https://preview--pizzaspinrewards.netlify.app

Latest commit: `9af1d06` - "Add graceful error handling and debug logging for email marketing"

## 📝 Next Steps

1. Create database tables using the SQL in `docs/email-marketing-setup.md`
2. Configure Resend API key and FROM email in Netlify
3. Test sending emails
4. If everything works, merge preview → main branch
