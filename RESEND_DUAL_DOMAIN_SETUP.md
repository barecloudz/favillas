# Resend Dual-Domain Email Setup Guide

## ‚úÖ Strategy: Main Domain + Subdomain

Your app uses **two different domains** for sending emails:

| Email Type | Sent From | Why |
|------------|-----------|-----|
| **Order Confirmations** | `orders@favillaspizzeria.com` | Main domain = trusted, critical |
| **Password Resets** | `noreply@favillaspizzeria.com` | Main domain = trusted, critical |
| **Marketing Campaigns** | `noreply@updates.favillaspizzeria.com` | Subdomain = isolated reputation |

**All replies go to:** `info@favillaspizzeria.com`

---

## üéØ Why This Strategy?

### Transactional Emails (Main Domain):
‚úÖ **Critical** - customers NEED order confirmations
‚úÖ **Trusted** - customers recognize your actual business domain
‚úÖ **Maximum deliverability** - main domain has best reputation
‚úÖ **Professional** - `orders@favillaspizzeria.com` > `noreply@updates...`

### Marketing Emails (Subdomain):
‚úÖ **Isolated** - spam complaints don't affect critical emails
‚úÖ **Protected** - keeps your main domain reputation clean
‚úÖ **Monitored** - track marketing performance separately
‚úÖ **Scalable** - can add more subdomains for different campaigns

---

## üìã Setup Steps

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Verify Subdomain (DONE!)

You already completed this:
- Domain verified: `updates.favillaspizzeria.com`
- DNS records added (MX, SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
- Status: **Verified** ‚úÖ

---

### üîß Step 2: Verify Main Domain (REQUIRED!)

Since order confirmations send from `orders@favillaspizzeria.com`, you need to verify the main domain too.

**In Resend Dashboard:**

1. Click **"Domains"** ‚Üí **"Add Domain"**
2. Enter: `favillaspizzeria.com` (main domain, not subdomain)
3. Resend will show DNS records to add

**Add These Records to Netlify DNS:**

Resend will show you exact values, but they'll look similar to:

#### SPF Record:
```
Type: TXT
Name: favillaspizzeria.com (or just "@")
Value: v=spf1 include:_spf.resend.com ~all
TTL: Auto
```

#### DKIM Record:
```
Type: TXT
Name: resend._domainkey
Value: p=MIGfMA0GCS... [long string from Resend]
TTL: Auto
```

#### DMARC Record:
```
Type: TXT
Name: _dmarc
Value: v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:postmaster@favillaspizzeria.com
TTL: Auto
```

**Note:** If you already have SPF or DMARC records, you'll need to **merge** them:

**Existing SPF:**
```
v=spf1 include:netlify.com ~all
```

**Updated SPF (merged):**
```
v=spf1 include:_spf.resend.com include:netlify.com ~all
```

---

### Step 3: Get Resend API Key (if not done yet)

1. Resend Dashboard ‚Üí **"API Keys"**
2. Click **"Create API Key"**
3. Name: "Favillas Pizza Production"
4. Copy the key (starts with `re_...`)

---

### Step 4: Add API Key to Netlify

**In Netlify Dashboard:**
1. Site Configuration ‚Üí Environment Variables
2. Add variable:
   ```
   Key: RESEND_API_KEY
   Value: re_your_api_key_here
   ```
3. Save (Netlify auto-redeploys)

---

## üß™ Testing Your Setup

### Test 1: Marketing Email (Subdomain)

**Via Admin Dashboard:**
1. Go to `https://favillaspizzeria.com/admin`
2. Click **"Email Marketing"** tab
3. Create Campaign ‚Üí Select template
4. **Test Mode** ‚Üí Enter your email
5. Send

**Check email:**
- FROM: `Favillas Pizzeria <noreply@updates.favillaspizzeria.com>` ‚úÖ
- REPLY-TO: `info@favillaspizzeria.com` ‚úÖ

---

### Test 2: Order Confirmation (Main Domain)

**Place a test order:**
1. Add items to cart
2. Complete checkout
3. Check your email

**Check email:**
- FROM: `Favillas Pizzeria <orders@favillaspizzeria.com>` ‚úÖ
- REPLY-TO: `info@favillaspizzeria.com>` ‚úÖ
- Subject: `Order Confirmation - #12345 | Favillas Pizzeria` ‚úÖ

---

## üìä Domain Verification Status

Check both domains are verified in Resend:

| Domain | Status | Used For |
|--------|--------|----------|
| `updates.favillaspizzeria.com` | ‚úÖ Verified | Marketing campaigns |
| `favillaspizzeria.com` | ‚è≥ Pending | Order confirmations, password resets |

**Both must show green checkmarks before emails will send!**

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Domain not verified" error

**Solution:**
1. Check DNS records are added correctly in Netlify
2. Wait 30 minutes for DNS propagation
3. Click "Verify" button in Resend dashboard
4. Check for typos in record values

---

### Issue: Emails from main domain not sending

**Solution:**
1. Verify `favillaspizzeria.com` is verified in Resend (green checkmark)
2. Check `RESEND_API_KEY` is set in Netlify
3. Check Netlify function logs for errors
4. Ensure DNS records for main domain are correct

---

### Issue: SPF record conflict

If you get "SPF record already exists":

**Bad (multiple SPF records):**
```
v=spf1 include:netlify.com ~all
v=spf1 include:_spf.resend.com ~all  ‚ùå Won't work!
```

**Good (merged SPF record):**
```
v=spf1 include:netlify.com include:_spf.resend.com ~all  ‚úÖ
```

Only ONE SPF record per domain is allowed. Merge all includes into one record.
