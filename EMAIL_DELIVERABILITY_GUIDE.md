# Email Deliverability Guide - Avoid Spam Folder

## üéØ Current Status

Your emails are going to spam because:
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è Domain is new/has low sender reputation
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to warm up your sending domain
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing some authentication records
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Email content might trigger spam filters

---

## ‚úÖ Immediate Fixes (Do These First)

### 1. Verify All DNS Records Are Set

Check that these records exist for `favillaspizzeria.com`:

```bash
# Check SPF record
nslookup -type=TXT favillaspizzeria.com

# Check DKIM record
nslookup -type=TXT resend._domainkey.favillaspizzeria.com

# Check DMARC record
nslookup -type=TXT _dmarc.favillaspizzeria.com
```

**Expected Results:**

**SPF Record:**
```
v=spf1 include:_spf.resend.com ~all
```

**DKIM Record:**
```
v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=[long key from Resend]
```

**DMARC Record:**
```
v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc-reports@favillaspizzeria.com
```

### 2. Update DMARC Policy (If Too Strict)

If your DMARC is set to `p=reject`, change it to `p=quarantine` or `p=none` while warming up:

```
v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc-reports@favillaspizzeria.com
```

This allows emails to be delivered while monitoring for issues.

### 3. Add SPF for Your Main Domain

Make sure you have SPF record for the main domain, not just subdomain:

```
Type: TXT
Name: @ (or favillaspizzeria.com)
Value: v=spf1 include:_spf.resend.com ~all
TTL: 3600
```

## üî• Domain Warm-Up Strategy

**Why Warming Up Matters:**
- New domains have no sending reputation
- ISPs (Gmail, Outlook) don't trust new senders
- Sudden high volume = spam flag

**Warm-Up Schedule:**

| Week | Daily Limit | Total Week | Action |
|------|------------|------------|---------|
| Week 1 | 10-20 emails | 100 emails | Send to engaged users only |
| Week 2 | 50 emails | 350 emails | Increase gradually |
| Week 3 | 100 emails | 700 emails | Monitor bounce/spam rates |
| Week 4 | 250 emails | 1,750 emails | Normal operations begin |

**Rules During Warm-Up:**
1. ‚úÖ Send to engaged/active customers first
2. ‚úÖ Avoid sending to old/inactive emails
3. ‚úÖ Monitor open rates (should be >20%)
4. ‚úÖ Remove bounced emails immediately
5. ‚ùå Don't send to purchased email lists
6. ‚ùå Don't send daily campaigns yet

## üéØ Resend-Specific Improvements

### 1. Add Custom Return-Path

In your Resend DNS settings, add a custom return-path:

```
Type: CNAME
Name: resend
Value: feedback.resend.com
TTL: 3600
```

### 2. Enable Click & Open Tracking

These improve deliverability signals:
- Open tracking shows engagement
- Click tracking shows legitimate links

### 3. Use Tags Effectively

Already implemented! Tags help Resend monitor campaign performance:
```typescript
tags: [
  { name: 'type', value: 'marketing_campaign' },
  { name: 'campaign', value: 'Loyalty_Reward' },
  { name: 'user_id', value: '123' }
]
```

## üí∞ Consider Email Warm-Up Service

If you need faster warm-up, use a service:

**Warmup Inbox** (Recommended)
- Cost: ~$19/month
- Automatically sends emails between real accounts
- Builds reputation faster
- Works with Resend

**How it works:**
1. Sign up at warmupinbox.com
2. Connect your Resend SMTP
3. It sends/receives emails automatically
4. Builds sender reputation over 2-4 weeks

## üîç Test Your Current Setup

Run these commands to check DNS:

```bash
# Check if SPF is set
dig TXT favillaspizzeria.com +short | grep spf

# Check if DKIM is set
dig TXT resend._domainkey.favillaspizzeria.com +short

# Check if DMARC is set
dig TXT _dmarc.favillaspizzeria.com +short
```

**Expected output:**
```
SPF: "v=spf1 include:_spf.resend.com ~all"
DKIM: "v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=MIGfMA0GCSq..."
DMARC: "v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:..."
```
