### 4. Rewards System Tests ✅ PASSED (2/2)

| Endpoint | Method | Status | Result |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| /api/rewards | GET | 200 | ✅ Retrieved 8 rewards |
| /api/user/rewards (no auth) | GET | 401 | ✅ Requires authentication |

**Findings:**
- Rewards catalog is properly configured with 8 active rewards
- User-specific rewards properly require authentication
- Response caching is enabled for public rewards endpoint

---

### 5. Order Processing Tests ⚠️ PARTIAL (3/3 auth tests, issues found)

| Endpoint | Method | Status | Result | Issue |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| /api/orders (no auth) | GET | 401 | ✅ Requires authentication | - |
| /api/kitchen/orders (no auth) | GET | 401 | ✅ Requires authentication | - |
| /api/orders POST (no auth) | POST | 400 | ⚠️ Database constraint error | Check constraint violation |

**Critical Findings:**

#### 🔴 **CRITICAL: No Transaction Management**
- Order creation, order items insertion, and points awarding are **not wrapped in database transactions**
- If order creation succeeds but points awarding fails, points are lost
- If order items insertion fails after order creation, orphaned orders result
- **Risk:** Data inconsistency, lost points, incomplete orders

**Example flow without transaction:**
```
1. Create order (SUCCESS)
2. Create order items (FAILURE) <- Order exists but has no items
3. Award points (NOT EXECUTED) <- Points never awarded
```

#### 🔴 **CRITICAL: Database Constraint Mismatch**
- Database has a check constraint requiring user identification: `orders_user_identification_check`
- Code attempts to support guest orders but constraint prevents this
- Error: `new row for relation "orders" violates check constraint "orders_user_identification_check"`
- **Either:** Remove constraint to allow guest orders, **OR:** Require authentication for all orders

#### 🟡 **MODERATE: Points Awarding Race Conditions**
The points system uses UPSERT logic but doesn't guarantee atomicity:

```sql
-- Current implementation (not atomic for new users)
INSERT INTO user_points (user_id, points, ...) VALUES (...)
ON CONFLICT (user_id) DO UPDATE SET points = user_points.points + ${amount}
```

**Issue:** If two orders complete simultaneously for a new user:
1. Both check if user exists (both get "no")
2. Both try to INSERT
3. One succeeds, one gets conflict
4. The UPDATE might use stale `user_points.points` value

**Solution:** Use `FOR UPDATE` locking or proper serializable transactions

#### 🟡 **Order Creation Flow Issues:**
1. **Server-side price validation exists** but has complex logic to handle both individual and total prices
2. **Price manipulation risk:** Frontend prices are trusted if "reasonable" (within 50%-200% of base price)
3. **Voucher discount validation:** Voucher discounts are applied based on frontend metadata without server-side voucher lookup
4. **Payment status handling:** Orders can be created with payment_status='succeeded' from Stripe webhook

---

### 6. Admin & Kitchen Endpoints ✅ PASSED (4/4)

| Endpoint | Method | Status | Result |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| /api/admin/system-settings (no auth) | GET | 401 | ✅ Requires admin auth |
| /api/admin/delivery-zones (no auth) | GET | 401 | ✅ Requires admin auth |
| /api/tax-settings | GET | 200 | ✅ Public access (intended) |
| /api/restaurant-settings | GET | 200 | ✅ Public access (intended) |

**Findings:**
- Admin endpoints properly require authentication and role validation
- Public settings endpoints are intentionally accessible for checkout flow
- No sensitive information exposed in public settings

---

### 7. Store Configuration Tests 🔴 FAILED (0/1)

| Endpoint | Method | Status | Result | Error |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| /api/store-hours | GET | 500 | 🔴 Database error | Table doesn't exist |

**Critical Finding:**

#### 🔴 **CRITICAL: Missing Database Table**
```
Error: Failed query: select ... from "store_hours" ...
```

The `store_hours` table referenced in the API code does not exist in the production database.

**Impact:**
- Customers cannot view store hours
- Order scheduling may be affected
- Admin cannot configure business hours

**Solution Required:**
1. Run database migration to create `store_hours` table
2. Seed with default hours (code has auto-creation logic but it's failing)
3. Verify table schema matches Drizzle ORM definition in `shared/schema.ts`

---

### 8. Error Handling Tests ✅ PASSED (2/2)

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Invalid endpoint (404) | ✅ Correctly returns 404 |
| Malformed JSON | ✅ Returns 400 Bad Request |

**Findings:**
- Error responses are consistent and appropriate
- No stack traces or sensitive info in production errors
- ⚠️ Some error messages expose query details (e.g., store_hours error shows full SQL)

---

## Integration Points Analysis

### Stripe Payment Processing 🟡 MODERATE

**Code Review Findings:**

✅ **Strengths:**
- Webhook signature verification is implemented
- Payment intent handling supports both flows (order-first and payment-first)
- Proper status updates on successful payment

⚠️ **Issues:**
1. **No idempotency checks:** Webhook could be processed multiple times
2. **Order creation from webhook lacks authentication:** Uses internal API call without auth
3. **No retry logic:** Failed order creation after successful payment leaves payment orphaned
4. **No webhook failure notification:** Silent failures possible

**Recommendation:**
- Add idempotency key checking using `payment_intent_id`
- Implement webhook retry queue with exponential backoff
- Add monitoring/alerting for failed webhook processing

### ShipDay Delivery Integration 🟡 MODERATE

**Code Review Findings:**

✅ **Strengths:**
- Detailed order item formatting with addons
- Scheduled delivery support
- Proper address validation

⚠️ **Issues:**
1. **Hardcoded pickup address:** Restaurant address is hardcoded, not from settings
2. **No retry logic:** Failed ShipDay creation leaves delivery unscheduled
3. **Status sync:** No webhook handler for ShipDay status updates
4. **No cancellation handling:** Can't cancel ShipDay order if customer cancels

**Recommendation:**
- Move restaurant settings to database configuration
- Implement ShipDay webhook handler for status updates
- Add delivery cancellation support
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff

### Supabase Authentication ✅ GOOD

**Code Review Findings:**

✅ **Strengths:**
- Dual support for Supabase JWT and legacy tokens
- Proper user metadata extraction from Google OAuth
- Database user creation/linking works correctly
- Role-based access control integrated

✅ **No issues found** - Implementation is solid

## Recommendations for Production

### Immediate Actions (Before Production Deploy)

1. **Fix store_hours table**
   ```sql
   -- Run this migration
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS store_hours (
     id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
     day_of_week INTEGER NOT NULL,
     day_name VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
     is_open BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
     open_time TIME,
     close_time TIME,
     is_break_time BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
     break_start_time TIME,
     break_end_time TIME,
     created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
     updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
     CONSTRAINT unique_day_of_week UNIQUE (day_of_week)
   );
   ```

2. **Implement database transactions for order creation**
   ```typescript
   // Pseudo-code
   await sql.begin(async (tx) => {
     const order = await tx`INSERT INTO orders ... RETURNING *`;
     await tx`INSERT INTO order_items ...`;
     await tx`INSERT INTO points_transactions ...`;
     await tx`UPDATE user_points ...`;
   });
   ```

3. **Fix guest order constraint**
   - Either: Remove `orders_user_identification_check` constraint
   - Or: Require authentication for all orders (recommended for points tracking)

### Short-term Improvements (Within 2 Weeks)

4. **Add Stripe webhook idempotency**
   ```typescript
   const existing = await sql`
     SELECT id FROM orders WHERE payment_intent_id = ${paymentIntentId}
   `;
   if (existing.length > 0) return; // Already processed
   ```

5. **Implement server-side price validation**
   - Calculate total from menu_items.base_price
   - Validate vouchers against database
   - Never trust frontend prices

6. **Add points system locking**
   ```typescript
   await sql`
     SELECT * FROM user_points
     WHERE user_id = ${userId}
     FOR UPDATE
   `;
