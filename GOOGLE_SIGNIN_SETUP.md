# Google Sign-In Setup Guide

## âœ… Current Status: CONFIGURED

Your Google Sign-In is now properly configured with your client ID: `195346900975-jtncf56nht40kp3ik9oncc4fkm6b46hd.apps.googleusercontent.com`

## What's Been Set Up

1. **Google Platform Library** - Added to HTML
2. **Google Client ID** - Configured in HTML meta tag
3. **Google Sign-In Buttons** - Replaced custom buttons with proper `g-signin2` divs
4. **Backend Integration** - Updated callback handler to process Google authentication
5. **User Management** - Automatic user creation/login for Google users

## Testing Your Setup

1. **Start your development server**
2. **Navigate to the auth page** (`/auth`)
3. **Look for the Google Sign-In button** - it should appear as a proper Google-styled button
4. **Click the button** - it should open Google's OAuth flow
5. **Complete the sign-in** - you should be redirected back and logged in

## Troubleshooting

### If you see a 404 error:
- Make sure your development server is running
- Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
- Verify the Google Platform Library script is loading

### If the Google button doesn't appear:
- Check that the meta tag is properly set in the HTML
- Verify the Google Platform Library script loaded
- Look for any JavaScript errors in the console

### If sign-in fails:
- Check your Google Cloud Console OAuth settings
- Verify your redirect URIs are configured correctly
- Make sure your domain is authorized

## Google Cloud Console Configuration

Make sure your OAuth 2.0 client has these settings:

**Authorized JavaScript origins:**
- `http://localhost:3000` (for development)
- `https://yourdomain.com` (for production)

**Authorized redirect URIs:**
- `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/google/callback` (for development)
- `https://yourdomain.com/api/auth/google/callback` (for production)

## Environment Variables

Your Netlify environment should have:
```env
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=195346900975-jtncf56nht40kp3ik9oncc4fkm6b46hd.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret_here
```

## Security Notes

- The client ID is safe to expose in frontend code
- Never expose the client secret in frontend code
- Use HTTPS in production
- Consider implementing server-side ID token verification for enhanced security

## Current Implementation

The setup uses:
- Client-side Google Sign-In button with proper Google styling
- ID token verification (basic implementation)
- Automatic user creation/login
- Session management with cookies
- Proper error handling and logging
