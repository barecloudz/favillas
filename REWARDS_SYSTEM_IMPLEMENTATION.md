# Pizza Spin Rewards System - Production Implementation

## Overview

A complete customer rewards system has been implemented for the Pizza Spin application, featuring points earning, redemption, and comprehensive administration tools. The system is production-ready with full transactional integrity, error handling, and audit logging.

## Core Features Implemented

### 1. Points Earning System
- **Automatic Points Award**: Points are automatically awarded when orders are completed
- **Configurable Rate**: 1 point per $1 spent (configurable via loyalty program settings)
- **Bonus Multiplier**: Orders over threshold receive bonus points (e.g., 1.5x for orders $50+)
- **First Order Bonus**: New customers receive extra points on their first completed order
- **Signup Bonus**: New customer registrations automatically receive welcome points

### 2. Points Redemption System
- **Thread-Safe Transactions**: All redemptions use database transactions to prevent race conditions
- **Real-Time Validation**: Points balance and reward availability checked before redemption
- **Expiration Management**: Redemptions expire after 30 days if unused
- **Redemption Limits**: Rewards can have maximum redemption counts
- **Order Integration**: Redemptions can be linked to specific orders during checkout

### 3. Rewards Management
- **Flexible Reward Types**: Support for discounts, free items, free delivery, percentage discounts
- **Admin Management**: Full CRUD operations for rewards catalog
- **Status Control**: Rewards can be activated/deactivated without deletion
- **Usage Tracking**: Real-time tracking of redemption counts and limits

### 4. Loyalty Program Configuration
- **Dynamic Settings**: Points rates, bonuses, and thresholds are configurable
- **Program Management**: Admins can update loyalty program rules without code changes
- **Multiple Programs**: Support for different loyalty program configurations

## API Endpoints Implemented

### Customer Endpoints

#### `GET /api/customer/points`
Get customer's current points balance and transaction history.
```json
{
  "points": { "id": 1, "userId": 1, "points": 250, "totalEarned": 500, "totalRedeemed": 250 },
  "transactions": [...],
  "loyaltyProgram": { "pointsPerDollar": "1.00", ... }
}
```

#### `GET /api/customer/rewards`

  "upcomingRewards": [...]
}
```

#### `POST /api/customer/redeem`
Redeem points for a specific reward.
```json
{
  "rewardId": 1,
  "orderId": 123
}
```

### Admin Endpoints

#### `GET /api/admin/points`
Get all customer points data or specific user's points and transactions.
```json
{
  "users": [...] // All customers with points data
}
```

#### `POST /api/admin/points`
Award or adjust customer points manually.
```json

  "type": "bonus"
}
```

```json
{
  "name": "Free Large Pizza",
  "description": "Any large pizza with up to 3 toppings",
  "pointsRequired": 500,
  "rewardType": "free_item",
  "rewardValue": "18.99",
  "maxRedemptions": 100
}
```

#### `GET /api/admin/loyalty-program`
Get current loyalty program configuration.

#### `POST /api/admin/loyalty-program`
Create or update loyalty program settings.

## Database Schema

The system uses the existing database schema with these key tables:

- **`user_points`**: Customer points balances and totals
- **`points_transactions`**: Complete audit log of all points activities
- **`points_rewards`**: Catalog of available rewards
- **`user_points_redemptions`**: Record of all redemptions
- **`loyalty_program`**: Configurable program settings

## Integration Points

### Order Completion Integration
Located in: `/api/orders/[id]/status.ts`

When an order status is changed to "completed":
1. Checks if this is a transition from non-completed status
2. Calculates points based on order total and loyalty program rules
3. Awards base points + any applicable bonuses
4. Creates transaction records for audit trail
5. Logs all activities for debugging

### User Registration Integration
Located in: `/api/auth/register.ts`

When a new customer registers:
1. Creates user account as normal
2. Awards configured signup bonus points
3. Creates initial points record and transaction
4. Returns signup points awarded in response

### Storage Layer Integration
Located in: `/server/storage.ts`

Enhanced the storage interface and DatabaseStorage class with:
- Points transaction management
- Reward catalog operations  
- Redemption validation and processing
- Comprehensive error handling

## Business Logic

### Points Calculation
```javascript
// Base points: 1 point per dollar
let points = Math.floor(orderAmount * pointsPerDollar);

// Bonus for large orders (configurable threshold and multiplier)
if (orderAmount >= bonusThreshold) {
  points = Math.floor(points * bonusMultiplier);
}

// First order bonus
if (isFirstOrder) {
  points += pointsForFirstOrder;
}
```

### Redemption Validation
1. **Reward Exists**: Verify reward ID is valid and active
2. **Sufficient Points**: User has enough points for the reward
3. **Redemption Limits**: Reward hasn't exceeded max redemptions
4. **Transaction Safety**: Use database transactions for atomicity

### Error Handling
- **Validation Errors**: Return 400 with descriptive messages
- **Authentication**: Return 401 for invalid/missing tokens
- **Authorization**: Return 403 for insufficient permissions
- **Not Found**: Return 404 for missing resources
- **Server Errors**: Return 500 with error details (non-sensitive)

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT token validation on all endpoints
- Role-based access control (customer vs admin endpoints)
- User can only access their own points data

### Data Integrity
- Database transactions for all multi-step operations
- Row locking to prevent race conditions during redemptions
- Audit logging of all points activities

### Input Validation
- Comprehensive validation of all request parameters
- Type checking and range validation for numeric values
- Sanitization of user-provided descriptions and names

## Production Considerations

### Performance
- Optimized database queries with proper indexing
- Serverless-friendly connection pooling
- Efficient pagination for transaction history

### Monitoring & Debugging
- Comprehensive logging of all points activities
- Error logging with stack traces
- Transaction IDs for debugging failed operations

### Scalability
- Stateless API design
- Database-driven configuration (no hardcoded values)
- Efficient queries that scale with user base

## Testing

A test script has been created at `/test-rewards-api.js` to validate all endpoints:

```bash
node test-rewards-api.js
```

The script tests:
- Customer points retrieval
- Available rewards listing
- Admin points management
- Reward creation and management
- Loyalty program configuration
- Points redemption flow

## Usage Examples

### Awarding Points on Order Completion
```javascript
// This happens automatically when order status changes to 'completed'
const pointsResult = await awardPointsForOrderCompletion(
  userId,      // Customer who placed the order
  orderId,     // Order being completed
  orderTotal   // Order amount for points calculation
);
```

### Manual Points Adjustment (Admin)
```javascript
// POST /api/admin/points
{
  "userId": 123,
  "points": 50,           // Positive = award, negative = deduct
  "description": "Compensation for late delivery",
  "type": "bonus"
}
```

### Creating a New Reward
```javascript
// POST /api/admin/rewards
{
  "name": "Free Garlic Bread",
  "description": "Complimentary garlic bread with any order",
  "pointsRequired": 150,
  "rewardType": "free_item",
  "rewardValue": "4.99",
  "isActive": true,
  "maxRedemptions": 500
}
```

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Database Migration**: Ensure all schema changes are applied to production
2. **Environment Variables**: Configure loyalty program settings for production
3. **Initial Rewards**: Create initial rewards catalog via admin interface  
4. **Staff Training**: Train staff on admin interfaces for points management
5. **Customer Communication**: Inform customers about the new rewards program
6. **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring for points transactions and redemptions

The rewards system is now fully implemented and ready for production deployment with comprehensive functionality, security, and error handling.
