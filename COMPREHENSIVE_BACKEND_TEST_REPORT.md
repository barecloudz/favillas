## 🚨 CRITICAL FINDINGS

### 1. STORE HOURS MANAGEMENT (CRITICAL PRIORITY)

**Issue:** Missing `/api/store-hours` API endpoint
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED
**Impact:** Users cannot update restaurant operating hours from admin dashboard

**Root Cause:**
- Frontend admin dashboard expects `/api/store-hours` endpoint
- No corresponding backend API handler existed
- Store hours table exists in database but no API layer

**Resolution Implemented:**
- Created complete `/api/store-hours.ts` endpoint with full CRUD operations
- Added authentication/authorization for admin-only access
- Supports GET (retrieve hours), PUT (update single day), POST (bulk update)
- Added auto-creation of default hours (11:00-22:00) for all days if none exist
- Added proper error handling and validation

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `C:\Users\Blake\OneDrive\PizzaSpinRewards\api\store-hours.ts` (NEW)
- `C:\Users\Blake\OneDrive\PizzaSpinRewards\netlify.toml` (Added redirects)

---

### 2. DATABASE SCHEMA MISMATCHES (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Issues:** Multiple API endpoints failing due to incorrect table/column references
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED
**Impact:** Several admin features returning 500 errors

**Specific Fixes Implemented:**

#### Menu Items API (`/api/menu-items`)
- **Problem:** Querying non-existent `category_id` column
- **Fix:** Changed to use `category` column (text field as per actual schema)
- **Files Modified:** `api/menu-items.ts`

#### Tax Settings API (`/api/tax-settings`)
- **Problem:** Querying wrong table structure
- **Fix:** Corrected to use `system_settings` table with proper column aliases
- **Files Modified:** `api/tax-settings.ts`

#### Pause Services API (`/api/pause-services`)
- **Problem:** Querying wrong table structure
- **Fix:** Corrected to use `system_settings` table approach
- **Files Modified:** `api/pause-services.ts`

## 🔧 FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Created Store Hours API Endpoint
```typescript
// New file: api/store-hours.ts
- Full CRUD operations for store hours management
- Admin authentication required for modifications
- Automatic default hours creation
- Support for break times and closed days
- Proper error handling and validation
```

### 2. Fixed Database Schema Mismatches
```sql
-- menu-items.ts
- Changed: SELECT * FROM menu_items ORDER BY category_id, name
+ Changed: SELECT * FROM menu_items ORDER BY category, name

-- tax-settings.ts
- Changed: SELECT * FROM system_settings WHERE key LIKE 'tax_%'
+ Changed: SELECT setting_key as key, setting_value as value FROM system_settings WHERE setting_key LIKE 'tax_%'

-- pause-services.ts
- Similar system_settings table approach fix
```

### 3. Updated Netlify Configuration
```toml
# Added to netlify.toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/store-hours"
  to = "/.netlify/functions/store-hours"
  status = 200

[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/store-hours/*"
  to = "/.netlify/functions/store-hours"
  status = 200
```
