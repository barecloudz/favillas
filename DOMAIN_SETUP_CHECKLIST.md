# Domain Setup Checklist: updates.favillaspizzeria.com

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Root domain `favillaspizzeria.com` already configured on Netlify
- ‚úÖ CORS configuration updated in code
- ‚è≥ Subdomain `updates.favillaspizzeria.com` needs to be added

---

## Step 1: Add Subdomain in Netlify Dashboard (2 minutes)

Since Netlify CLI doesn't support adding domains, do this in the dashboard:

1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/projects/pizzaspin
2. Click **"Domain management"** in the left sidebar
3. Click **"Add a domain alias"**
4. Enter: `updates.favillaspizzeria.com`
5. Click **"Verify"**
6. Netlify will automatically:
   - Create the DNS CNAME record (you're using Netlify DNS)
   - Provision SSL certificate (1-2 minutes)
   - Enable HTTPS

---

## Step 2: Update Google OAuth Settings (5 minutes)

Your app uses Google OAuth for login, so you need to add the new domain:

1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
2. Find your OAuth 2.0 Client ID (the one you're currently using)
3. Click **Edit**
4. Under **"Authorized redirect URIs"**, add:
   ```
   https://updates.favillaspizzeria.com/auth/callback
   ```
5. Under **"Authorized JavaScript origins"**, add:
   ```
   https://updates.favillaspizzeria.com
   ```
6. Click **"Save"**

---

## Step 3: Update Supabase Settings (3 minutes)

Your app uses Supabase for authentication:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Click **"Authentication"** ‚Üí **"URL Configuration"**
3. Add to **"Site URL"**:
   ```
   https://updates.favillaspizzeria.com
   ```
4. Add to **"Redirect URLs"**:
   ```
   https://updates.favillaspizzeria.com/**
   https://updates.favillaspizzeria.com/auth/callback
   ```
5. Click **"Save"**

---

## Step 4: Update Resend Email Domain (Optional - for email marketing)

When you set up Resend, you'll want to verify the domain:

1. In Resend dashboard: https://resend.com/domains
2. Add domain: `favillaspizzeria.com` (root domain, not subdomain)
3. Add the DNS records Resend provides (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
4. Wait for verification

**Note**: The email addresses in your code are already set to:
- From: `noreply@favillasnypizza.com`
- Reply-To: `info@favillasnypizza.com`

You may want to update these in `api/email/resend-client.ts` to match `favillaspizzeria.com`

---

## Step 5: Deploy the Code Changes

The CORS configuration has been updated. Deploy to production:

```bash
git push origin preview
```

Or merge preview ‚Üí main if ready for production.

---

## Step 6: Test Everything (10 minutes)

Once the domain is added and SSL is provisioned:

1. **Visit the site**: https://updates.favillaspizzeria.com
   - Should load with SSL lock icon üîí

2. **Test Google Login**:
   - Click "Sign In with Google"
   - Should redirect properly
   - Should log you in successfully

3. **Test Order Flow**:
   - Add items to cart
   - Go to checkout
   - Submit an order
   - Check if order confirmation appears

4. **Test Admin Dashboard**:
   - Log in as admin
   - Verify all features work
   - Check if APIs respond correctly

---

## Environment Variables Already Set

These should already be configured in Netlify:
- ‚úÖ `DATABASE_URL`
- ‚úÖ `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
- ‚úÖ `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`
- ‚úÖ `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
- ‚úÖ `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY`
- ‚úÖ `SHIPDAY_API_KEY`

**Still Needed**:
- ‚è≥ `RESEND_API_KEY` (for email functionality)

---

## Code Files Updated

- ‚úÖ `api/_shared/cors.ts` - Added `updates.favillaspizzeria.com` to allowed origins
- ‚úÖ `api/email/resend-client.ts` - Email addresses set to `favillasnypizza.com`

---

## Quick Reference

**Current Domains**:
- Production: `https://favillaspizzeria.com` (root)
- Production: `https://updates.favillaspizzeria.com` (subdomain - being added)
- Preview: `https://preview--pizzaspin.netlify.app`
- Netlify default: `https://pizzaspin.netlify.app`

**Admin Panel**: `https://updates.favillaspizzeria.com/admin`

**DNS Provider**: Netlify DNS (nameservers already pointed from Namecheap)

---

## Troubleshooting

**If SSL doesn't provision**:
- Wait 5 minutes, Netlify can be slow
- Check domain is correctly pointed in DNS
- Try removing and re-adding the domain

**If Google OAuth fails**:
- Check you added the EXACT redirect URI
- Clear browser cookies and try again
- Check Google Cloud Console for error messages

**If CORS errors occur**:
- Make sure code is deployed (`git push`)
- Check browser console for the exact origin being rejected
- Verify the origin is in the CORS list
