# Thermal Printer Setup Guide - iPad Edition

## Overview

Your thermal printer is configured to print directly from your iPad browser **without any server or computer running**. This uses the Epson ePOS SDK for JavaScript which works from HTTPS sites.

## Requirements

- **Epson TM-M30II** thermal printer (or compatible ePOS model)
- Printer connected to **same WiFi network** as your iPad
- Printer IP address: **192.168.1.208**
- **HTTPS enabled on printer** (port 8084) - Required for iPad printing from HTTPS sites
- ePOS-Print service enabled on printer

## How It Works

```
Order Placed on iPad

```

No server needed! The iPad talks directly to the printer on your local network.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Enable HTTPS on Printer (One-Time Setup)

The Epson TM-M30II must have HTTPS enabled to work from HTTPS websites (like your Netlify deployment).

**Method 1: Using Printer Web Interface**
1. On your iPad, open Safari
2. Go to `http://192.168.1.208`
3. You'll see the printer's web configuration page
4. Go to **SSL/TLS Settings**
5. Enable **SSL/TLS**
6. The printer will now accept HTTPS connections on port **8084**

**Method 2: Using Epson TM Utility App** (Recommended for iPad)
1. Download **Epson TM Utility** from the App Store
2. Open the app and connect to your printer (192.168.1.208)
3. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **SSL/TLS**
4. Enable SSL/TLS
5. Save changes

**Important**: After enabling HTTPS, you may need to accept the printer's self-signed certificate the first time you print.

### 2. Configure Printer in Admin Dashboard

1. Open your website on the iPad
2. Go to **Admin Dashboard** ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **Printer Configuration**
3. Click **Add Printer**
4. Enter printer details:
   - **Name**: Epson TM-M30II Kitchen
   - **IP Address**: 192.168.1.208
   - **Port**: 80 (this will be auto-upgraded to 8084 for HTTPS)
   - **Printer Type**: Epson TM-M30II
5. Click **Save**
6. Click **Set Primary** to make it the active printer

You should see a green "Active" badge on your printer.

### 3. Accept Printer SSL Certificate (First Time Only)

The first time you print, Safari may show a security warning about the printer's self-signed SSL certificate:

1. Click the üñ®Ô∏è **Print** button on an order
2. Safari may show: "Cannot verify server identity"
3. Tap **Show Details**
4. Tap **Visit this website**
5. Confirm you want to continue

This only needs to be done once. Future prints will work automatically.

### 4. Test Printing from iPad

1. Go to **Kitchen Display** on your iPad
2. Find any order
3. Click the üñ®Ô∏è **Print** button
4. The receipt should print automatically!

If it works, you're all set! üéâ

### 5. Automatic Printing on Orders (Optional)

Receipts can automatically print when orders are confirmed. This is configured in your order processing code.

## Troubleshooting

### Printer Not Printing

**Problem**: Click print but nothing prints

**Solutions**:

1. **Check iPad and printer are on same WiFi**
   - iPad must be on the same network as the printer
   - Check WiFi settings on iPad
   - Verify printer is connected to WiFi (print network status from printer)

2. **Verify printer IP address**
   - Current IP: 192.168.1.208
   - Print a printer status page to confirm IP
   - Update in Admin Dashboard if changed

3. **Check printer is turned on**
   - Power on the Epson TM-M30II
   - Wait for it to finish startup (about 30 seconds)

4. **Test printer connection from iPad**
   - Open Safari on iPad
   - Go to http://192.168.1.208
   - You should see the Epson ePOS-Print configuration page
   - If this doesn't load, the printer isn't reachable

5. **HTTPS/SSL not enabled**
   - The printer must have SSL/TLS enabled for HTTPS printing
   - Follow "Enable HTTPS on Printer" instructions above
   - Without HTTPS, Safari will block the print request from your HTTPS website

**Problem**: "Epson ePOS SDK not loaded" error

**Solution**:
- Refresh the webpage on your iPad
- Make sure you're using Safari (Chrome on iOS doesn't fully support ePOS SDK)
- Clear browser cache and reload

**Problem**: "Connection timeout" error

**Solution**:
- The printer may be sleeping - send a test print to wake it
- Restart the printer
- Check firewall settings if printer has one

### Set Primary Not Working

This was a bug that has been fixed. The "Set Primary" button now correctly:
1. Sets the selected printer as active
2. Sets all other printers as inactive
3. Shows a green "Active" badge on the primary printer
4. Updates immediately without page refresh

If you still have issues:
1. Refresh the page
2. Only one printer can be active at a time
3. The active printer is used for all print jobs

## iPad-Specific Notes

### Safari Required
- Use **Safari browser** on iPad for best compatibility
- Chrome and Firefox on iOS have limited ePOS SDK support

### Network Connection
- Keep iPad connected to WiFi (same network as printer)
- Don't use cellular data
- If WiFi drops, reconnect and try printing again

### Multiple iPads
- You can use multiple iPads
- All iPads must be on same network as printer
- Configure printer once, works on all devices

## Advanced Configuration

### Change Printer IP Address

If your printer's IP address changes:

1. Find new IP address (print network status from printer)
2. Go to Admin Dashboard ‚Üí Printer Configuration
3. Click Edit on your printer
4. Update IP address
5. Click Save
6. Test print to verify

### Add Multiple Printers

You can configure multiple printers:
1. Add each printer with unique IP address
2. Only one can be "Primary" (active) at a time
3. Click "Set Primary" to switch between printers
4. Useful for kitchen printer + customer receipt printer

## Technical Details

### HTTPS Printing Solution
The system prints directly from your HTTPS website to the printer using:
- **Port 8084**: Epson's HTTPS ePOS-Print port (bypasses mixed content restrictions)
- **Port 80 fallback**: HTTP printing (will be blocked by Safari unless insecure content is allowed)
- **ePOS-Print XML API**: Standard Epson thermal printer protocol
- **No server needed**: iPad browser talks directly to printer on WiFi

### How It Works
1. iPad browser sends HTTPS request to `https://192.168.1.208:8084/cgi-bin/epos/service.cgi`
2. Printer accepts HTTPS connection (using self-signed SSL certificate)
3. Browser sends ePOS-Print XML with receipt data
4. Printer parses XML and prints receipt
5. All communication stays on local WiFi network

### Receipt Format
Receipts include:
- **Header**: Restaurant name (FAVILLA'S NY PIZZA)
- **Order Info**: Order #, type (delivery/pickup), date/time
- **Customer Info**: Name, phone, address (for delivery)
- **Items**: Quantity, name, options, special instructions, price
- **Totals**: Subtotal, delivery fee, tax, tip, total
- **Special Instructions**: Order-level notes
- **Footer**: Thank you message

### Security
- All communication stays on your local network
- No data sent to external servers
- Printer must be on same WiFi as iPad (cannot print over internet)
