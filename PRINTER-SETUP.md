# Thermal Printer Setup Guide - iPad Edition

## Overview

Your thermal printer is configured to print directly from your iPad browser **without any server or computer running**. This uses the Epson ePOS SDK for JavaScript which works from HTTPS sites.

## Requirements

- Printer connected to **same WiFi network** as your iPad
- Printer IP address: **192.168.1.208**
- Printer port: **80** (default for ePOS-Print)

## How It Works

```
Order Placed on iPad
    ‚Üì
iPad browser calls Epson ePOS SDK
    ‚Üì
SDK connects directly to printer via WiFi (192.168.1.208:80)
    ‚Üì

No server needed! The iPad talks directly to the printer on your local network.

## Troubleshooting

### Printer Not Printing

**Problem**: Click print but nothing prints

**Solutions**:

1. **Check iPad and printer are on same WiFi**
   - iPad must be on the same network as the printer
   - Check WiFi settings on iPad
   - Verify printer is connected to WiFi (print network status from printer)

2. **Verify printer IP address**
   - Current IP: 192.168.1.208
   - Print a printer status page to confirm IP
   - Update in Admin Dashboard if changed

3. **Check printer is turned on**
   - Power on the Epson TM-M30II
   - Wait for it to finish startup (about 30 seconds)

4. **Test printer connection from iPad**
   - Open Safari on iPad
   - Go to http://192.168.1.208
   - You should see the Epson ePOS-Print configuration page
   - If this doesn't load, the printer isn't reachable

**Problem**: "Epson ePOS SDK not loaded" error

**Solution**:
- Refresh the webpage on your iPad
- Make sure you're using Safari (Chrome on iOS doesn't fully support ePOS SDK)
- Clear browser cache and reload

**Problem**: "Connection timeout" error

**Solution**:
- The printer may be sleeping - send a test print to wake it
- Restart the printer
- Check firewall settings if printer has one

### Set Primary Not Working

This was a bug that has been fixed. The "Set Primary" button now correctly:
1. Sets the selected printer as active
2. Sets all other printers as inactive
3. Shows a green "Active" badge on the primary printer
4. Updates immediately without page refresh

If you still have issues:
1. Refresh the page
2. Only one printer can be active at a time
3. The active printer is used for all print jobs

## iPad-Specific Notes

### Safari Required
- Use **Safari browser** on iPad for best compatibility
- Chrome and Firefox on iOS have limited ePOS SDK support

### Network Connection
- Keep iPad connected to WiFi (same network as printer)
- Don't use cellular data
- If WiFi drops, reconnect and try printing again

### Multiple iPads
- You can use multiple iPads
- All iPads must be on same network as printer
- Configure printer once, works on all devices

## Advanced Configuration

### Change Printer IP Address

If your printer's IP address changes:

1. Find new IP address (print network status from printer)
2. Go to Admin Dashboard ‚Üí Printer Configuration
3. Click Edit on your printer
4. Update IP address
5. Click Save
6. Test print to verify

### Add Multiple Printers

You can configure multiple printers:
1. Add each printer with unique IP address
2. Only one can be "Primary" (active) at a time
3. Click "Set Primary" to switch between printers
4. Useful for kitchen printer + customer receipt printer
